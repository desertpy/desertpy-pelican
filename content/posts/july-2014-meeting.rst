:summary: July 2014 Meeting


Monsoon season is upon us so join DesertPy this month for a Thunderstorm!  What
is a Thunderstorm you ask?  It's a meeting consisting only of lightning
talks!


When
  Wednesday **June 23rd, 2014** at **6:30PM**

Where
  Isos Technology - `1130 E University Drive, #101, Tempe, AZ 85281 <https://goo.gl/maps/RzPNQ>`_
  The Isos offices can be found on the south west side of the western building
  in the complex.  The building has 1130 in giant numbers on it.  Look for a
  sign on the door as we may have to let you in.  Enter through the door shown
  on the image below.

What
    There won't be one big talk, but a bunch of smaller, fast paced talks on any
    number of Python related topics.  Just show up for the fun.  Better yet, show
    up with a python related lightning talk of your own.  We will try to enforce a
    5 minute limit per talk.  More than one talk per person permitted.

    Recommendations:

    + If you use slides (which is recommended), do them in the IPython Notebook
      or export to a PDF.
    + Provide slides to me godber@gmail.com prior to the meeting to minimize
      laptop switching.
    + Make a comment on the Meetup event announcement that contains your topic,
      or topics, so we can avoid (minimize) duplication.

    These are recommendations and not requirements.  Don't let anything above
    discourage you from presenting.
