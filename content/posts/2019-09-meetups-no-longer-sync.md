Slug: Meetups are no longer synced to this site
Authors: Nelson Chen

Unfortunately, Meetup.com has made it extremely hard to pull meetup data
from their API in an automated way by a [server][ghissue].

We are no longer able to sync meetup posts to this site. Please check
out the meetup.com group in the menu bar of this site for the latest
meetup information.

[ghissue]: https://github.com/meetup/api/issues/325
