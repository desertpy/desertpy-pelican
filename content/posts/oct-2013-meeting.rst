What
  Ever want to mess around with network packets but the thought of writing a
  kernel module or figuring out tcpdump seem too daunting?  Now you can!  And
  from the comfort of everyone's favorite language!  Using Python, we can take
  packet inspection, logging, and firewalling to a new level that's not easily
  possible with existing tooling.


  Erik Stephens from Orvant will walk through the steps needed to get started
  inspecting packets from the Linux kernel the Python way.  He'll point out
  some pitfalls to avoid along the way.  He will also dive into a simple, but
  useful utility to help you report and block traffic from specific Linux
  programs.
