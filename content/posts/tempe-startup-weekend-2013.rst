:summary: Tempe Startup Weekend - 2013

It was requested that I forward along an announcement about a Startup Weekend
being held this month in Tempe.

Announcement
  "There is a Tempe Startup Weekend event (http://tempe.startupweekend.org)
  coming up on June 21st at the new ASU AREA48 Formation Space on Mill Ave.

  If you are unfamiliar with these events, Startup Weekends are 54-hour events
  sponsored by the Kauffman Foundation where developers, designers, marketers,
  product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form
  teams, build products and launch startups!"

It's interesting to learn that ASU is opening what they call a "Formation Space"
in downtown Tempe, on Mill: http://formationspace.com/

The flyer below includes a 15% off discount code for DesertPy group members.
