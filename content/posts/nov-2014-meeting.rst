What
  Trevor will share the best kept secrets of the Python Standard Library by
  talking about modules that are often overlooked but should not be.  Also, Ian
  will delight men, women, and children alike with a lightning talk so
  tantalizing that I can't even dare to tell you in advance!  (Honestly, I have
  no idea what Ian will talk about, but I have no doubts it will be interesting.)
