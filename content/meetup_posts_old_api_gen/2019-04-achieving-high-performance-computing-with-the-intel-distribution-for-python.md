<p>Main Meeting Topic: Achieving High-Performance Computing with the Intel® Distribution for Python</p> <p>6:30 - Mingling - Pizza sponsored by HiringSolved<br/>6:40 - Intro/Announcements<br/>6:50 - Talk - Achieving High-Performance Computing with the Intel® Distribution for Python<br/>8:20 - Depart for Social Gathering at Cornish Pasty Company, address below</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>Achieving High-Performance Computing with the Intel® Distribution for Python* – Python has had a reputation for being “slow” or “not performant” for many years, but a new set of technologies and methods have changed that perception to show that Python can be both high-productivity and high-performance at the same time. Learn more about the work Intel is doing to accelerate workloads in the space, and the methods that are used speed up popular packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.</p> <p>Learn more at:<br/><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python" class="linkified">https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python</a></p> <p>Our Speaker:</p> <p>David Liu is a Technical Consultant Engineer at Intel Corporation in Austin, Texas, where he represents Intel's Python products and projects. He is focused on solving customer problems in Python while simultaneously developing and shaping Intel's software products to match customer needs.
