<p>**NOTE**: I am going to try and move back to Wednesday nights, starting with this meeting.</p> <p># What</p> <p>"Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows." See: <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" class="linkified">https://airflow.apache.org/</a></p> <p>Austin has an Airflow server up and running and will provide a few examples of writing Python code that implement workflows in Airflow. Exact details of the examples are still TBD.</p> <p>It would be awesome if a couple other people also implemented example workflows to share with the group. Please comment below if you have something to contribute, it doesn't matter if you are an expert and have something ready to share now or want to implement something as a learning experience.</p> <p># When</p> <p>Wednesday October 24th at 6:30PM.</p> <p># Where</p> <p>Workuity is a co-work space at 24th and Camelback across from the Biltmore. Park in surface parking and enter building 2390, Workuity is on the first floor on the north side of the lobby. We'll be meeting in the common area. The surface parking is free after hours.</p> <p><a href="https://www.workuity.com/" class="linkified">https://www.workuity.com/</a></p>
