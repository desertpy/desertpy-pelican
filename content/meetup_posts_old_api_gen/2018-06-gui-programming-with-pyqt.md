<p>NOTICE: I am exploring the possibility of changing locations, if you or your employer has a space that would be convenient and fit 30+ people please contact me. Otherwise this will be held at UAT in a classroom upstairs, 201 most likely.</p> <p>What:</p> <p>PyQt is a UI framework designed in C++ and ported to Python. In fact you don't necessarily need to use Python to utilize the Qt library. But today we'll be using Python as I find it easier to create the application quickly.<br/>Today we will be building a game using this framework. The game is blackjack. I'll go over the rules today and then we will begin building the application.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>My name is Nicholas Finch, I am a Software Engineer over at USGS. I've spent 2 years now working on an application dedicated to helping scientists analyze rock samples from Mars. This application of course is designed in PyQt, which I will be teaching today.</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>UAT Upstairs Room 201 most likely.</p>
