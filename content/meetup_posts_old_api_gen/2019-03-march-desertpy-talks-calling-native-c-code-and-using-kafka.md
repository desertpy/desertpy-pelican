<p>Main Meeting Topic: Calling Native C code and using Kafka</p> <p>6:30 - Mingling - Pizza provided by McKesson<br/>6:40 - Intro/Announcements<br/>6:50 - Talks<br/>* Calling C from Python - Dave Kaspar<br/>* Getting started with Stream Processing with Kafka and Python - Austin Godber<br/>8:20 - Depart for Social Gathering at Tap House Kitchen, address below</p> <p>Note that the topics covered this month are a little more advanced and both talks will assume the audience has an understanding of Python or at least a willingness to dive into the deep end. Those new to Python are always welcome though!</p> <p>What:</p> <p>Calling C from Python - We like writing in Python, but sometimes to overcome its limitations or for the sake of convenience we want to call out to native libraries. This talk will introduce the standard library's ctypes module and demonstrate its use with a simple example.</p> <p>Bio: Dave Kaspar earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, and has held postdoctoral appointments at Brown and Arizona State University. He has published papers on nonlinear partial differential equations, probability, and statistical physics, and more recently has been working on applied Bayesian inference.</p> <p>Getting started with Stream Processing using Kafka and Python - A quick intro to Kafka, a distributed log system, and how to interact with it using Python.</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>McKesson in Scottsdale (The middle of three buildings, Bldg. #2). When you enter security will have the RSVP list, have you sign in on the iPads, and direct you down the hall to the meetup room.</p> <p>Social Gathering:</p> <p>Come socialize with us after the meeting at TapHouse Kitchen right after the meeting, around 8:30 or 8:45 PM at:</p> <p>TapHouse Kitchen<br/>6137 North Scottsdale Road #108<br/>Scottsdale, AZ 85250</p>
