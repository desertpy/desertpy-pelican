<p>There are so many options when it comes to visualizing your data in Python that it makes very little sense for one person to attempt to learn all of the different libraries available. For this meetup, we'd like to assemble teams to represent what each of these libraries (and others) have to offer by completing a series of plotting tasks (located here: <a href="https://github.com/tjslezak/battle-of-the-plotting-libraries" class="linkified">https://github.com/tjslezak/battle-of-the-plotting-libraries</a>).</p> <p>Each team will use the same datasets (procured specifically for this meeting) to complete a series of data visualization tasks and then present their results and code to the group. Whether you are a seasoned data visualization expert or just someone looking for a reason to learn a new visualization library, we’d love to hear and learn something new from you – sign up to join a team using this link (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbjDNq8KK3dQDm7o95AhISovZiuvl7_9zOhDzkaifHU/edit?usp=sharing" class="linkified">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbjDNq8KK3dQDm7o95AhISovZiuvl7_9zOhDzkaifHU/edit?usp=sharing</a>).</p> <p>Feel free to add in any library you’d like to represent that is not listed.</p> <p>Please note the change in location for this meeting. Thanks to Cubic/TeraLogics for hosting. They're hiring. Talk to John if you're interested in learning about what they do.</p>
