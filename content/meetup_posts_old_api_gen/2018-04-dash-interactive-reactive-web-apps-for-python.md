<p>Blair will introduce and live-code a Dash App. Dash is a Python web framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required! Built on top of Plotly, React.js, and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs to your analytical Python code.</p> <p>This talk is aimed at folks who are comfortable working in an Anaconda environment. If that’s not you then that’s ok! You will still be able to appreciate the power of interactive visualizations and how Python creates those visuals. What you will walk away with is the ability to get started on programing up your own Dash Apps.</p> <p><a href="https://plot.ly/products/dash/" class="linkified">https://plot.ly/products/dash/</a></p> <p><a href="https://dash.plot.ly/gallery" class="linkified">https://dash.plot.ly/gallery</a></p> <p><a href="https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started" class="linkified">https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started</a></p> <p>If you want to code along then it will be helpful to to have the required packages installed.</p> <p>The packages to install are:</p> <p>pip install dash<br/>pip install dash-renderer<br/>pip install dash-html-components<br/>pip install dash-core-components<br/>pip install plotly</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Blair is a Galvanize Data Science Alumni with an interest in consulting, visualization, and creating access to Machine Learning. He currently works in the Admissions team within Galvanize. When he’s not doing Data Science projects he probably either cuddling with his cats, wandering a history museum, or playing some dorky video game (any Crusader Kings fans out there?).</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>Galvanize, Phoenix Warehouse District</p>
