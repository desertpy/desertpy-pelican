<p>What:</p> <p>Show and Tell, bring something you're working on or discovered and tell us about it! I'll have a few things to share, hopefully, someone else will too.</p> <p>McKesson will be providing Pizza and Soda!</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>McKesson in Scottsdale (The middle of three buildings, Bldg. #2). When you enter security will have the RSVP list, have you sign in on the iPads, and direct you down the hall to the meetup room.</p> <p>Note, this venue seats 26 so please keep your RSVP updated!</p>
