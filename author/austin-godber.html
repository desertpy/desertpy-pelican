<p>Main Meeting Topic: Achieving High-Performance Computing with the Intel® Distribution for Python</p>

<p><p>6:30 - Mingling - Pizza sponsored by HiringSolved<br/>6:40 - Intro/Announcements<br/>6:50 - Talk - Achieving High-Performance Computing with the Intel® Distribution for Python<br/>8:20 - Depart for Social Gathering at Cornish Pasty Company, address below</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>Achieving High-Performance Computing with the Intel® Distribution for Python* – Python has had a reputation for being “slow” or “not performant” for many years, but a new set of technologies and methods have changed that perception to show that Python can be both high-productivity and high-performance at the same time. Learn more about the work Intel is doing to accelerate workloads in the space, and the methods that are used speed up popular packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.</p> <p>Learn more at:<br/><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python" class="linkified">https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python</a></p> <p>Our Speaker:</p> <p>David Liu is a Technical Consultant Engineer at Intel Corporation in Austin, Texas, where he represents Intel's Python products and projects. He is focused on solving customer problems in Python while simultaneously developing and shaping Intel's software products to match customer needs. In the past, he worked as a software engineer utilizing Python in machine learning, network infrastructure, and web work.<br/>David holds an MS in Software Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>Galvanize<br/>515 E Grant St<br/>Phoenix, AZ 85004</p> <p>Social Gathering:</p> <p>Come socialize with us after the meeting at Cornish Pasty Company right after the meeting, around 8:30 or 8:45 PM at:</p> <p>Cornish Pasty Company<br/>7 W Monroe St,<br/>Phoenix, AZ 85003</p> </p>

<p>Main Meeting Topic: Calling Native C code and using Kafka</p>

<p><p>6:30 - Mingling - Pizza provided by McKesson<br/>6:40 - Intro/Announcements<br/>6:50 - Talks<br/><em> Calling C from Python - Dave Kaspar<br/></em> Getting started with Stream Processing with Kafka and Python - Austin Godber<br/>8:20 - Depart for Social Gathering at Tap House Kitchen, address below</p> <p>Note that the topics covered this month are a little more advanced and both talks will assume the audience has an understanding of Python or at least a willingness to dive into the deep end. Those new to Python are always welcome though!</p> <p>What:</p> <p>Calling C from Python - We like writing in Python, but sometimes to overcome its limitations or for the sake of convenience we want to call out to native libraries. This talk will introduce the standard library's ctypes module and demonstrate its use with a simple example.</p> <p>Bio: Dave Kaspar earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, and has held postdoctoral appointments at Brown and Arizona State University. He has published papers on nonlinear partial differential equations, probability, and statistical physics, and more recently has been working on applied Bayesian inference.</p> <p>Getting started with Stream Processing using Kafka and Python - A quick intro to Kafka, a distributed log system, and how to interact with it using Python.</p> <p>Where:</p> <p>McKesson in Scottsdale (The middle of three buildings, Bldg. #2).

<p>**NOTE**: I am going to try and move back to Wednesday nights, starting with this meeting.</p>

<p><p># What</p> <p>"Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows." See: <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" class="linkified">https://airflow.apache.org/</a></p> <p>Austin has an Airflow server up and running and will provide a few examples of writing Python code that implement workflows in Airflow. Exact details of the examples are still TBD.</p> <p>It would be awesome if a couple other people also implemented example workflows to share with the group. Please comment below if you have something to contribute, it doesn't matter if you are an expert and have something ready to share now or want to implement something as a learning experience.</p> <p># When</p> <p>Wednesday October 24th at 6:30PM.</p> <p># Where</p> <p>Workuity is a co-work space at 24th and Camelback across from the Biltmore. Park in surface parking and enter building 2390, Workuity is on the first floor on the north side of the lobby. We'll be meeting in the common area. The surface parking is free after hours.</p> <p><a href="https://www.workuity.com/" class="linkified">https://www.workuity.com/</a></p> </p>
